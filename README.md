# ✨ Starr Kanban

> Internal productivity suite for Starr Street Media — built to flex with the creative and technical demands of a growing team.

**Starr Kanban** was an in-house tool developed to manage our workflows, track team tasks, and close skill gaps through structured learning requests. Whether we were producing films, building software, or launching internal initiatives, Starr Kanban kept us aligned.

## 🎬 Why It Was Built

We needed a tool that:
- Matched the *diverse workflows* of a startup doing both media and software  
- Encouraged continuous learning through *structured requests*  
- Could *evolve fast* without dependency on external platforms

Starr Kanban did exactly that, quietly keeping things moving behind the scenes.
